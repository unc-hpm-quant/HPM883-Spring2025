This is a template for a Pre-Analysis Plan (PAP), roughly following guidelines from the American Economic Association (AEA) and the World Bank’s Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) group.

## Helpful Resources:

-   For guidance on pre-analysis plans, refer to the World Bank’s DIME Wiki: [Pre-Analysis Plan - DIME Wiki](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Pre-Analysis_Plan)

-   For examples of pre-analysis plans, explore the AEA’s RCT Registry: [AEA RCT Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/)
