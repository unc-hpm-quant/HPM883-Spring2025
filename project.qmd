# Project Title: Designing, Simulating, and Analyzing an Online Experiment

## Overview:

This semester-long project will provide students with hands-on experience in the full research lifecycle, from experimental design to data analysis and reporting. Working in pairs, students will design an online experiment and either **simulate the data** or conduct the experiment with real participants. The project will emphasize **causal inference** methods and require the application of **at least one machine learning technique** in the analysis phase. The goal is to develop methodological and analytical skills for causal inference, experimental health services research, and modern data science approaches.

## Deliverables:

The project will be divided into the following key deliverables:

1.  A Pre-analysis Plan: A document that outlines the experimental design and analysis plan.
2.  A Peer-Reviewed Referee Report: A document that assesses the validity and feasibility of the experimental design and analytical methods.
3.  A Final Submission: A report that includes the experimental design, methods, results, and discussion.

## Project Components and Timeline:

### Phase 1: Project Proposal (Due by Jan ):

Students will work in pairs to brainstorm and propose an online experiment.

The project proposal should include: 

- Research question and motivation
- Specific hypotheses to be tested 
- Brief experimental design outline 
- Whether the data will be simulated or collected from real participants 
    - Potential participant pool (if using real participants) 

Submit your project proposal on gradescope here: [LINK]

### Phase 2: Pre-Analysis Plan (Due by ):

After approval, students will have six weeks to prepare a comprehensive pre-analysis plan. This document must include:

-   Detailed experimental design
-   Specification of whether the data will be simulated or collected from real participants
-   Description of the randomization strategy
-   List of primary and secondary outcomes
-   Planned statistical analyses
-   Ethical considerations and consent forms (if applicable)


### Phase 3: Peer Review (Due by )

To promote collaborative learning and critical evaluation, pre-analysis plans will be randomly allocated to classmates for peer review.

Each student will review one pre-analysis plan and submit a referee report within one week. The referee report should assess:
- Clarity of the research question and hypotheses
- Validity and feasibility of the experimental design
- Appropriateness of the analytical strategies and transparency

A template/guide for the referee report will be provided.

### Phase 4: Final Submission (Due by )

Students can choose between two options:

#### Option 1: Paper using Simulated Data

Students will generate synthetic data based on the proposed experimental design. Methods for generating simulated data will be covered in a lab session. The simulated dataset should match the proposed experiment in structure and key characteristics.

#### Option 2: Running the Experiment with Real Participants

-   If choosing to run the experiment, students will conduct the approved design with real participants (classmates, friends, or external groups).
    -   Instead of recruiting the number of participants required based on power simulations, running a small-scale "pilot" with just a few participants (2-3 per experimental condition) is acceptable.
-   Data should be collected ethically and stored securely following UNC standards.

The final project package should include:

1.  Manuscript/Registered Report: A complete research paper structured like a journal article, including:

-   Abstract
-   Introduction and Literature Review
-   Methods Section (including experiment design and pre-analysis plan)
-   Results
-   Discussion and Conclusion


2. Push-Button Replication Package: A well-organized folder containing:

-   The raw data or simulated data and simulation code
-   Cleaned datasets
-   Code/scripts for analysis (R)
-   README file explaining how to replicate the results

### Grading Criteria:

1. Pre-Analysis Plan: 40% 
2. Peer Review Report: 20% 
3. Final Submission: 40%

## FAQ:

-   How do I come up with a research question and hypotheses?
-   How do I conduct the experiment if I choose to recruit real participants?
-   What is the ethical guidelines for collecting data from real participants?
-   How do I simulate data for the experiment if I choose to use simulated data?
