# **Designing and Analyzing an Experiment in Health Services Research**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

With the semester project, you'll dive into the full experimental research lifecycle and apply the tools and techniques you’re learning in this course. Working in your assigned group, you’ll design an experiment to answer a meaningful research question of your choosing, develop a pre-analysis plan, and analyze data (we'll simulate the data given time constraints). By the end of the semester, you’ll have a manuscript and replication package that showcase your ability to design, execute, and report on a rigorous experimental research project. This is your opportunity to apply what we learn in class to a topic of interest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Deliverables

### 1. Pre-Analysis Plan (50% of grade)

The Pre-Analysis Plan (PAP) ensures your experiment is well-conceived, transparent, and analytically rigorous. This document lays out your research design and specifies how you will analyze the data.

#### **Requirements:**

-   **Introduction and Background:** Explain your research question and its significance.\
-   **Hypotheses:** Clearly state primary and secondary hypotheses.\
-   **Experimental Design:**
    -   Type of experiment (e.g., lab, online A/B test, field).\
    -   Random assignment procedure.\
    -   Treatment and control conditions.\
    -   Participant details (e.g., recruitment, sample size, inclusion criteria).\
-   **Key Outcomes:** Define primary and secondary outcomes and describe how they will be measured.\
-   **Analytical Strategy:**
    -   Specify statistical methods and models.\
    -   Incorporate analysis related to compliance or heterogeneous treatment effects.\
    -   Use a machine learning approach (e.g., predicting treatment heterogeneity or analyzing secondary outcomes).\
    -   Address how you will handle multiple hypotheses testing, if applicable.\
-   **Limitations:** Discuss potential weaknesses and their impact on findings.

#### **Grading Criteria:**

-   Clarity and Completeness (40%)\
-   Rigor of Design and Analysis (40%)\
-   Feasibility and Practicality (20%)

#### **Helpful Resources:**

### 2. Final Manuscript and Replication Package (50% of grade)

This deliverable includes a journal-style manuscript and a replication package to showcase your research findings and ensure reproducibility.

#### **Requirements:**

1.  **Final Manuscript:** (10–15 pages)
    -   **Abstract:** Concise summary of your study and findings.
    -   **Introduction:** Background and motivation for your research.
    -   **Methods:** Detailed description of your experimental design, treatments, and analytical approach.
    -   **Results:** Clear presentation of findings, including tables and figures.
    -   **Discussion:** Interpretation, limitations, and implications for future research or policy.
    -   **References:** Properly formatted citations.
2.  **Replication Package:**
    -   **Simulated Data:** Dataset formatted for analysis.
    -   **Code:** Well-documented scripts (R or Python recommended) for data cleaning and analysis, incorporating machine learning where appropriate.
    -   **README File:** Detailed instructions for replicating your analysis.

#### **Grading Criteria:**

-   **Manuscript:**
    -   Writing Quality and Organization (20%)
    -   Clarity and Depth of Analysis (30%)
-   **Replication Package:**
    -   Reproducibility (30%)
    -   Completeness and Documentation (20%)
