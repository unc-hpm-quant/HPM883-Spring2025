## Learning Objectives

1. Learn importance of reproducible research
2. Learn key principles of reproducible research
3. Learn how to design and implement a reproducible research workflow 
    - Version control using git and github
    - Literate programming using Quarto
    - Package managemenet using `renv`

## Preparation

### 1. **Read/Watch/Listen**:

- Review [Computing](computing.qmd) page
- Skim: [Reproducibility Lecture](/unit-0/lec-0-3.qmd)

### 2. **Computing Setup**:

To ensure a smooth experience during class, **please follow these steps**:

1. **Install R (v4.x or later)**
   - [CRAN Download](https://cloud.r-project.org/) or via your preferred package manager.

2. **Install RStudio** or a similar IDE
   - [RStudio Download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

3. **Install Quarto**
   - [Quarto Installation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) – ensures you can render .qmd files.

4. **Install Git**
   - Confirm Git is accessible from the command line:  
     ```bash
     git --version
     ```
   - Windows: [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)  
   - macOS: Use Xcode Command Line Tools or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

5. **Create a GitHub Account**
   - [GitHub Signup](https://github.com/) – used for version control and code sharing.

6. **Set Up Credentials (SSH keys or PAT)**
   - Helps push/pull to GitHub without repeated logins.  
   - GitHub Docs: [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

7. **Install Required R Packages**
   - In R/RStudio, run:
     ```r
     install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                        "renv",
                        "devtools",
                        "broom",
                        "infer",
                        "rmarkdown",
                        "quarto"))
     ```

8. **Optional but Recommended: Set Up Renv**
   - We will use `renv` to manage R package versions.  
   - [Renv Documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

Once you have completed the above steps, you should be ready for our in-class activities.
