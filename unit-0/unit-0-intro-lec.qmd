# "Tour de Course"

## Experiments and Machine Learning for HSR

-   **Causal Inference**:
    -   Randomized experiments: the gold standard for testing mechanisms and prioritizing interpretability.
-   **Machine Learning**:
    -   Ideal for useful predictions when interpretability or theory is less critical.
-   **Bridging the Divide**:
    -   New methods integrate ML principles with causal inference.
    -   Expand theory-building capabilities while testing hypotheses.

## Increasing Relevance

-   Health services research increasingly uses:
    -   Experimental methods.
    -   Machine learning tools.
-   Many causal hypotheses align with predictive relationships between phenomena.
-   Both approaches add value when combined.

## Importance of Reproducibility

### Reproducibility in Science

-   **Foundational Principle**:
    -   Good experiments are reproducible.
    -   The "reproducibility crisis" has affected some fields.
-   **Reproducibility and ML**:
    -   Exploratory analyses, when systematic, help build reliable theories.
    -   ML provides tools for:
        -   Conducting reproducible exploratory research.
        -   Identifying robust treatment effect heterogeneity.

# Core Themes of the Course

## Causal Inference as a Missing Data Problem

-   **The Fundamental Problem**:
    -   We cannot observe a unit in multiple states of the world simultaneously.
    -   Represented as "missing data" in potential outcomes.

:::

-   **Experimentation Solves under some key assumptions**:
    1.  SUTVA.
    2.  Observability.
    3.  Complete Compliance.
    4.  Statistical Independence.

## Randomization recovers the ATE on average.

## Experimental Problems: EP1 & EP2

### EP1: Internal Validity

-   **Understanding Effects of Causes**:
    -   Do assumptions in the potential outcomes framework hold?
    -   Mediators and moderators.

### EP2: External Validity

-   **Generalizability and Scalability**:
    -   Would it work in different settings?
    -   Can it scale to create meaningful impact?

# Primer on Experiments in Social Science

## Types of Experiments

-   **Lab Experiments**:
    -   Controlled settings, abstract framing, imposed rules.
-   **Field Experiments**:
    -   **Artefactual Field Experiment (AFE)**: Non-standard subject pool.
    -   **Framed Field Experiment (FFE)**: Adds field-specific context.
    -   **Natural Field Experiment (NFE)**: Subjects unaware they are in an experiment.
-   **Survey Experiments**:
    -   Embedded in survey designs.

## Criteria Defining Field Experiments

-   **Subjects and Environment**:
    -   Selection into experiments.
    -   Nature of tasks, commodities, stakes.
-   **Question:** Do experiments require randomization?
    -   *Reveal*: No, theory can serve as the counterfactual.

## Choosing the Right Experiment

-   **Weigh Costs and Benefits**:
    -   **Benefits**:
        -   EP1: Internal validity.
        -   EP2: Generalizability and scalability.
    -   **Costs**:
        -   Monetary, logistical, and opportunity costs.
