# "Tour de Course"

## Experiments and Machine Learning for HSR

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   **Randomized experiments:** the **gold standard** for testing mechanisms and interpretability.
-   **Machine Learning**: Ideal for useful predictions when interpretability or theory is less critical.
-   **Bridging the Divide**:
    -   New methods apply core ML principles to causal inference.
        -   As we'll see, parts of causal inference problems can be recast as prediction problems.
    -   Powerful tools for theory-building and expanding scope of feasible research.

**Important!**

You'll hear the term "causal machine learning" in the literature. **This is a misnomer!**

Machine Learning is about prediction. **Period**. It does not magically solve the causal inference problem.

**It CAN**:

1.  Help strengthen plausibility of existing exclusion restriction in some cases
2.  Allow us to study treatment effect heterogeneity in new ways

## Reproducibility

### Reproducibility is a Fundamental Principle of Science

-   Good experiments are necessarily reproducible.
    -   Clear, well-documented protocols, reproducible data collection, and clear and reproducible analysis.
    -   The "reproducibility crisis" in some fields (e.g. psychology). This is actually a good thing! Only possible to confirm results if they are reproducible.
-   **Reproducibility and ML**:
    -   Exploratory analyses, when systematic, help build reliable theories.
    -   ML provides tools for:
        -   Conducting reproducible exploratory research.
        -   Identifying robust treatment effect heterogeneity.

# Core Themes of the Course

## Causal Inference as a Missing Data Problem

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**:
    -   We cannot observe a unit in multiple states of the world simultaneously.
    -   Represented as "missing data" in potential outcomes.
-   **Experimentation Solves under some key assumptions**:
    1.  SUTVA.
    2.  Observability.
    3.  Complete Compliance.
    4.  Statistical Independence.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
| Unit | Treatment (W) | Y(0) | Y(1) | Observed Outcome |
|------|---------------|------|------|------------------|
| 1    | 1             | ?    | 5    | 5                |
| 2    | 0             | 3    | ?    | 3                |
| 3    | 1             | ?    | 6    | 6                |
| 4    | 0             | 4    | ?    | 4                |

-   **Problem:** We can only observe either (Y(0)) or (Y(1)) but not both for any individual.
:::
:::::

## Randomization recovers the ATE on average.

-   Potential outcomes: $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$
-   Treatment indicator: $W_i = 1$ if treated, $W_i = 0$ if control
-   Observed outcome: $Y_i = W_iY_i(1) + (1 - W_i)Y_i(0)$
-   Average Treatment Effect (ATE): $\tau = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]$

Randomization ensures that treatment is **independent** of potential outcomes:

$$
W_i \perp \!\!\! \perp (Y_i(0), Y_i(1)),
$$

Hence, $\mathbb{E}[Y | W_i = w] = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(w) | W_i = w] = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(w)]$ for all $w \in \{0, 1\}$.

Therefore, the difference between $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ is the ATE:\
$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)] = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)] - \mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)] = \tau.
$$

## Experimental Problems: EP1 & EP2

### EP1: Internal Validity

1.  **The Effects of Causes** (Internal Validity):
    -   Do assumptions in the potential outcomes framework hold?
2.  **The Causes of Effects** (Mediators and Moderators):
    -   What drives the effects we see?

### EP2: External Validity

1.  **Generalizability**: Would it work in different settings?

    -   People / populations
    -   Contexts

2.  **Scalability**: Can it scale to create meaningful impact?

-   **Lab Experiments**: Controlled settings, abstract framing, imposed rules.
-   **Field Experiments**:
    -   **Artefactual Field Experiment (AFE)**: Non-standard subject pool.
    -   **Framed Field Experiment (FFE)**: Adds field-specific context.
    -   **Natural Field Experiment (NFE)**: Subjects unaware they are in an experiment.
-   **Survey Experiments**:
    -   Embedded in survey designs.

## 7 Criteria that define field experiments

-   **Experimental Subjects: Population and Selection**
    -   The nature of the subject pool
    -   The nature of the information that subjects bring to the experimental task
    -   Selection into the experiment
-   **Experimental Environment**
    -   The nature of the commodity in the experiment
    -   The nature of the experimental task
    -   The nature of the stakes
    -   Experimental proclamation
