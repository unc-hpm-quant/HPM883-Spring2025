title: "Unit 6: Generalizability and Scalability"
draft: false
---

## Unit Overview

-   Discusses the concepts of generalizability (external validity) and scalability in translating research findings into policy and practice.
-   Covers common challenges like "voltage drop" and List's Five Vital Signs for diagnosing scaling failures.
-   Explores strategies for designing research *for* scale (e.g., backward induction, Option C).
-   Presents frameworks (e.g., Glennerster) for assessing the applicability of existing evidence to new contexts.

### Preparation

-   Read:
    -   List, J. A. (2024). Optimally generate policy-based evidence before scaling. *Nature*, *626*(7998), 491â€“499. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06972-y
    -   Review: Framework for Generalizability (Glennerster, based on J-PAL materials discussed in lecture)
-   Listen: [Internal Validity Podcast](media/InternalValidity.mp3)
