## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of heterogeneous treatment effects and why they matter
- Distinguish between individual treatment effects, average treatment effects, and conditional average treatment effects
- Apply different approaches to analyze treatment effect heterogeneity
- Understand the strengths and limitations of pre-specified and data-driven approaches
- Interpret heterogeneity findings in published research

---

## Individual Treatment Effects

**Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)**: $T_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$

- The individual-specific causal effect of the treatment
- $Y_i(1)$ is the potential outcome under treatment
- $Y_i(0)$ is the potential outcome under control

**Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**:

- We only observe one potential outcome per individual
- It's impossible to directly observe individual treatment effects
- This makes identifying individual effects infeasible in between-subjects designs

---

## Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

Given the fundamental problem, we focus on the Average Treatment Effect:

$$
\tau = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]
$$

- ATE answers: "What is the expected change in outcome if we randomly select a unit from the population and apply the treatment?"
- ATE is estimable through randomization
- **Limitation**: Assuming equal effect for all subjects is often unrealistic
- Interest in how treatment effects vary with subject characteristics

---

## Examples of Interest in Heterogeneity

**Real-world examples where heterogeneity matters**:

- Preventive screening effectiveness: How the benefits of cancer screenings or other preventive services vary by age, risk status, and other patient characteristics
- Telehealth disparities: How rural and urban populations may experience different benefits from telehealth interventions (particularly relevant given the expansion of telehealth)
- Care coordination effectiveness: How complex patients with multiple comorbidities might benefit differently from care coordination programs
- Adherence interventions: How socioeconomic factors might moderate the effectiveness of programs to improve medication adherence
- Value-based payment impacts: How provider characteristics influence responses to payment reform

---

## Reasons for Interest in Heterogeneity

::: incremental
1. **Targeting Treatment**
   - Should we direct interventions to certain types of people?
   - Can help maximize impact with limited resources
   - Ethical considerations in allocation

2. **Understanding Mechanisms**
   - Why did treatment work or not work?
   - Helps refine interventions and theory

3. **External Validity**
   - Will effects generalize to new populations?
   - Crucial for policy scale-up decisions
:::

## Moderation Analysis

**Moderation Analysis**: Examines how treatment effects differ based on pre-determined covariates (moderators)

**Types of moderation analysis:**

- **Descriptive**: Do treatment effects differ based on pre-determined covariates?
- **Causal**: If we independently varied the moderator, would we see the same CATEs?

**Interpretation:**

- Focus not just on measuring heterogeneities, but understanding why they exist
- Descriptive heterogeneity doesn't necessarily imply causal moderation

---

## Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs)

**Definition**:
$$
\tau(x) = E[\tau(x) | X_i = x] = E[Y_i(1, x) - Y_i(0, x) | X_i = x]
$$

- Average treatment effect for a subgroup with characteristics $X_i = x$
- Potential interest in changes in CATEs:
  $$
  \Delta\tau(X_i) = E[Y_i(1,1) - Y_i(1,0) - Y_i(0,1) - Y_i(0,0)]
  $$

**Limitation**:

- This object is not directly observed in data
- Each unit only provides a single potential outcome
- Each unit has only a single level of $X_i$

---

## Differences in CATEs

We can measure differences between $\tau(x)$ for different levels of $X_i$:

$$
\Delta\hat\tau(X_i) = \tau(1) - \tau(0) = E[\tau_i(1) | X_i = 1] - E[\tau_i(0) | X_i = 0]
$$

**Important Note**:

- $\Delta\hat\tau(X_i)$ is descriptive, not causal
- It can show whether CATE is higher for different levels of $X_i$
- Cannot answer whether there is a causal effect of $X$ on the treatment effect
- But still highly valuable for policy and implementation

## Example

**Home-based Parenting Intervention in Rural China (Sylvia et al. 2021)**

**Background**:

- Randomized experiment evaluating home-based parenting program delivered by family planning cadres in rural China
- Program significantly increased infant skill development after six months
- Beyond ATE, wanted to understand heterogeneous effects

**Reasons for examining heterogeneity**:

- Targeting: Identify which children benefited most
- Generalization: Understand how effects might vary in other populations
- Mechanisms: Gain insights into how the program worked

## Approach 1: Pre-specified Hypotheses

**Simple case**: A small set of distinct subgroups that we hypothesize to summarize heterogeneity

With sufficient sample sizes per subgroup, treat each subgroup as a "mini-RCT":

- Estimate $\hat\tau(X) = E[\tau(X) | X_i = X]$
- Hold $X$ fixed in estimation
- Can be done separately or using interaction terms in regression

**Example**: Analyzing treatment effects by baseline parental investment levels

---

## Sample Size and HTE

- Moderation analysis requires larger samples or larger MDEs
- Considerations:

  - Moderation effects are often smaller than main effects
  - You can have smaller samples when comparing subgroups
  - Subgroups don't have to be evenly split

- Design implications:

  - Consider oversampling key subgroups
  - Power calculations should account for heterogeneity analyses
  - Stratification can improve precision for key subgroups

---

## Challenges with Pre-specified Approaches

- Moderation analysis typically involves estimating a series of CATEs
- With many covariates, quickly becomes infeasible
  - Particularly with smaller samples
- Continuous covariates require functional form assumptions
- Difficult to discover/justify interactions of multiple variables ex post

**Partial solutions**:

- Pre-analysis plans
- Data-driven approaches to predict heterogeneity

---

## Approach 2: ML - Causal Forests 

**Causal forests** adapt random forest methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects:

- Trees are trained on subsets of data and features
- Goal is to partition data to maximize between-group heterogeneity while maintaining within-group homogeneity
- Repeated many times with random splits of the data
- ITE estimated by averaging over subgroup effects across iterations

**Advantages**:

- Can handle high-dimensional covariates
- Doesn't require functional form assumptions
- Can discover unexpected patterns of heterogeneity

---

## Case Study: Heterogeneity in China's Parenting Intervention

**Sylvia et al. (2021) study**:

- Evaluated home-based parenting program delivered by family planning cadres in rural China
- Used Generalized Random Forest (GRF) method to identify sources of heterogeneity
- Two-stage approach:
  1. Used GRF to identify important predictors of heterogeneity
  2. Used these insights for traditional subgroup analysis

## GRF Findings: Variable Importance

![](QQ-VI.png)

**Key predictors of heterogeneity:**
1. Baseline parental investment (27.16%)
2. Baseline infant skills (16.73%)
3. Distance to FPC office (12.51%)

## GRF-Informed Heterogeneity Analysis

## GRF-Informed Heterogeneity Analysis


**Findings:**

- Treatment effects significantly higher for children with low baseline parental investment
  - First quartile: +0.456 SD higher effect
- Children with below-median baseline skills benefited more
  - +0.340 SD higher effect
- No significant differences based on distance to FPC office

**Conclusion:** Program was most effective for disadvantaged children who lagged behind cognitively and had low initial parental investment

---

## Key Takeaways

- Heterogeneity analysis provides crucial insights beyond average effects
- Two main approaches:
  - Pre-specified subgroup analysis (theory-driven)
  - Data-driven methods like causal forests (exploratory)
- Best practice: Use both approaches complementarily
- Results can guide:
  - Program targeting
  - Mechanism understanding
  - External validity assessments

---

## Using Heterogeneity Insights

- **Program design**: Target children with greatest potential benefit
- **Resource allocation**: Direct resources where most effective
- **Implementation science**: Understand contextual factors affecting success
- **Theory development**: Refine understanding of causal mechanisms
- **Scale-up decisions**: Predict effectiveness in new populations
